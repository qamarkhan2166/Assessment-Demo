# Architecture
Implement Single Activity architecture

# Design 
no extrernal library is used for this task because we dont really not need. 

# Feedback 
if i have enough time then make a proper struture like extract common things from api and make a proper class. Improvement in design like rating bar etc.
provide option to use how they want to see the products like horizontal, Linear or Grid. we are getting large number of images so cache must be implement so that app performance will be improved .
